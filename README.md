This system is a web-based tool designed to implement the Round Robin algorithm for process scheduling. The Round Robin algorithm is commonly used in operating systems to allocate CPU time to processes in a fair and efficient manner.

Users input arrival times and burst times for different processes, along with a time quantum parameter. The system then processes this input and generates a Gantt chart and a table showing the schedule of processes based on the Round Robin algorithm. The output provides a visual representation of how CPU time is allocated to each process over time, helping users understand the scheduling behavior of the Round Robin algorithm.

This system was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS). HTML provides the structure and content of the webpage, CSS is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript handles the dynamic functionality, such as processing user input and generating the Round Robin schedule. The system also utilizes the BoxIcons library for displaying social media icons in the footer section.
